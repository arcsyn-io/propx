# ADR-004: Simple State Machine Testing

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Property-based testing is excellent for testing individual functions and data transformations, but many real-world systems involve stateful behavior that changes over time. Current property-based testing libraries often lack built-in support for testing state machines, forcing developers to implement complex state management manually.

### Key Requirements
- Test stateful systems with property-based testing
- Provide simple, intuitive API for state machine testing
- Support common state machine patterns
- Maintain compatibility with existing PropX generators
- Enable shrinking of state machine sequences
- Support both deterministic and non-deterministic state machines

### Problem Statement
Without state machine support:
- Developers must manually implement state management in tests
- Complex state transitions are difficult to test comprehensively
- State machine bugs are hard to reproduce and debug
- No standard way to shrink failing state sequences
- Testing concurrent state machines is particularly challenging

### Use Cases
- **Database Operations**: Testing CRUD operations with constraints
- **Game Logic**: Testing game state transitions and rules
- **Protocol Implementation**: Testing network protocol state machines
- **Business Logic**: Testing workflow and approval processes
- **Cache Systems**: Testing cache invalidation and updates
- **Finite State Machines**: Testing any system with discrete states

## Decision

**We will implement a simple state machine testing framework that allows developers to define state machines and test their behavior using property-based testing.**

### Proposed API Design

#### 1. State Machine Definition
```go
type StateMachine[S, C any] struct {
    InitialState S
    Commands     []Command[S, C]
}

type Command[S, C any] struct {
    Name        string
    Generator   gen.Generator[C]
    Execute     func(S, C) (S, error)
    Precondition func(S, C) bool
    Postcondition func(S, C, S) bool
}
```

#### 2. State Machine Testing
```go
func TestStateMachine[S, C any](t *testing.T, sm StateMachine[S, C], cfg prop.Config)
```

#### 3. Example Usage
```go
type BankAccount struct {
    Balance int
    Closed  bool
}

type BankCommand struct {
    Type   string // "deposit", "withdraw", "close"
    Amount int
}

func TestBankAccount(t *testing.T) {
    sm := StateMachine[BankAccount, BankCommand]{
        InitialState: BankAccount{Balance: 0, Closed: false},
        Commands: []Command[BankAccount, BankCommand]{
            {
                Name: "deposit",
                Generator: gen.Map(gen.IntRange(1, 1000), func(amount int) BankCommand {
                    return BankCommand{Type: "deposit", Amount: amount}
                }),
                Execute: func(state BankAccount, cmd BankCommand) (BankAccount, error) {
                    if state.Closed {
                        return state, errors.New("account is closed")
                    }
                    return BankAccount{Balance: state.Balance + cmd.Amount, Closed: state.Closed}, nil
                },
                Precondition: func(state BankAccount, cmd BankCommand) bool {
                    return !state.Closed
                },
            },
            {
                Name: "withdraw",
                Generator: gen.Map(gen.IntRange(1, 1000), func(amount int) BankCommand {
                    return BankCommand{Type: "withdraw", Amount: amount}
                }),
                Execute: func(state BankAccount, cmd BankCommand) (BankAccount, error) {
                    if state.Closed {
                        return state, errors.New("account is closed")
                    }
                    if state.Balance < cmd.Amount {
                        return state, errors.New("insufficient funds")
                    }
                    return BankAccount{Balance: state.Balance - cmd.Amount, Closed: state.Closed}, nil
                },
                Precondition: func(state BankAccount, cmd BankCommand) bool {
                    return !state.Closed && state.Balance >= cmd.Amount
                },
            },
            {
                Name: "close",
                Generator: gen.Const(BankCommand{Type: "close", Amount: 0}),
                Execute: func(state BankAccount, cmd BankCommand) (BankAccount, error) {
                    return BankAccount{Balance: state.Balance, Closed: true}, nil
                },
                Precondition: func(state BankAccount, cmd BankCommand) bool {
                    return !state.Closed
                },
            },
        },
    }

    prop.TestStateMachine(t, sm, prop.Default())
}
```

- No standard approach

### 3. Model-Based Testing
**Approach**: Implement full model-based testing framework.

**Rejected because**:
- Excessive complexity for most use cases
- Steep learning curve
- Overkill for simple state machines
- Difficult to implement shrinking

### 4. State Machine DSL
**Approach**: Create a domain-specific language for state machines.

**Rejected because**:
- Complex parser and compiler
- Limited Go integration
- Difficult to debug
- Over-engineering for the problem
