package quick // import "github.com/lucaskalb/rapidx/quick"

Package quick provides quick testing utilities for Go. It includes helper
functions for common testing patterns, particularly for value comparison and
assertion utilities.

FUNCTIONS

func Equal[T any](t *testing.T, got, want T)
    Equal compares two values of the same type and fails the test if they are
    not equal. It uses go-cmp for deep comparison and provides detailed diff
    output when values differ. The function calls t.Helper() to mark itself as a
    test helper function.

    Parameters:
      - t: The testing.T instance for the current test
      - got: The actual value obtained from the code under test
      - want: The expected value

    Example usage:

        quick.Equal(t, result, expected)
        quick.Equal(t, []int{1, 2, 3}, []int{1, 2, 3})
        quick.Equal(t, map[string]int{"a": 1}, map[string]int{"a": 1})
